How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?
Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. After you've determined which repository your enhancement suggestion is related to,
create an issue on that repository and provide the following information:

- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible.
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as Markdown code blocks.
- Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
- Include screenshots and animated GIFs which help you demonstrate the steps or point out where the suggestion is related to. You can use this tool to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and this tool or this tool on Linux.
- Specify the name and version of the OS you're using.
